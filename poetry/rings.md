This is an exploration of AI-aided creativity.\
Thanks to my (shadow) co-writer [Gemini] for being a sport. Sparring with you taught me a few
prompt formulations that would otherwise not occur to me. See an excerpt from our early exchanges below.

> **A note on the shift in perspective:** I've incorporated both first and third-person perspectives to offer a more nuanced and immersive experience. The first-person perspective allows for a more personal and intimate exploration of the poet's experiences, while the third-person perspective provides a broader, more objective view.

## Poem 1: Summit and Bay

Blank canvas, a mind, once serene and bright,\
now paints in shadows, lost in darkest night.\
Silent screams, cosmic mystic wars.\
Battlegrounds within, fought on all fours.\
Tapestries unravel, fringes fray.\
Deep in moonless night, devoid of day.\
Reality's grasp, a distant, fading shore,\
as consciousness shifts, a vessel adrift.\
A soul [unmoored][1], their spirit weep.\
Tapestry of thoughts, once woven tight, unravels,\
they fray, making all but one, [shorn][2] of light.

## Poem 2: The Link

Grandiose webs woven, neural mystic mazes,\
Thoughts intertwine in twilight's hazy phases.\
A symphony of minds, a telepathic trance,\
The chorus of one soul to a cosmic dance.\
That whisper's touch and knowing glance,\
Shared perception by psychic chance?\
A universe of thought, a fleeting flight,\
To glimpse the grand design\
and descend in pure delight.

## Poem 3: Magical Realm / Digital Realm

Cupboard doors, portals to the unknown,\
Bathroom mirrors and shower curtains,\
gateways overgrown.\
Puzzle pieces, keys, magic tones,\
Otherworldly voyages, destinations unknown.\
Realms of wonder, dreams, waking sights,\
Places of magic, ethereal lights.\
Hidden universes, celestial nights,\
Secret gardens, mystical delights.

Pixelated worlds swell, virtual expanses.\
Minds clash, grand theater of chances.\
Strategic games unfold, cosmic, mental trances.\
Victories fade, memories, faltering stances.\
Digital dreams ignite, virtual colourful delights.\
Moments slip away, when reality finally bites.\
Soar into cosmic journeys, bear arms, new heights.\
Hopeful prayers rise, guided by starry lights.

## Poem 4: Curbed

Sterile rooms enclose, silent yells,\
Captive minds tormented, loud ringing bells.\
Broken spirits yearn, souls that cannot quell,\
Haunting echoes linger, a mournful [knell][3].\
Stares glaze, distant, avoidant gazes,\
Minds adrift in twilight's somber mazes.\
Fragile hopes, flickering once blazes,\
Prisoners of the mind, in tireless, endless days.

## Poem 5: The Recovery

Dawning lights, glimmering faint and small,\
Fragile hopes, tentative recalls.\
Shattered minds, beginning to mend and crawl,\
Weary souls, answering nature's call.

Step by step, breath by breath, day by day,\
Journeys back from darkness to the ray.\
Fragile peace, a tentative hopeful way,\
New beginnings, a brighter, hopeful day.

## Poem 6: The Altered Perspective

A cosmic shift unfolds, a paradigm reborn.\
Universes of meaning, [animus][4] newly torn.\
Heightened senses awaken, visions keenly drawn,\
Sacred tapestries, masterpieces newly formed.

Deeper knowing unfolds, a silent, sacred grace.\
Consciousness expands through boundless time and space.\
Sacred missions, divine holy place,\
Higher purpose, celestial holy trace.

## Poem 7: The Lingering Echoes

Phantom echoes, whispers in the night,\
Fleeting memories, fading yonder light.\
Haunting presences loom, specters out of sight,\
Lingering shadows, fearful, frightful plight.

Silent fears, creeping nameless dread,\
Haunting memories persist, forever in your head.\
Fragile hopes flicker, nearly dead,\
Weary souls wander, haunted and misled.

## Poem 8: The Learnings of the Soul

Phoenixes rising, from ashes, strong and free,\
Spirits now mended, souls wise, eternally.\
Testaments to hope, victories, you see,\
Triumphs of the mind, in perpetuity.
