    \section{Preface}
    This is an exploration of AI-aided creativity.
    Thanks to my (shadow) co-writer Gemini for being a sport. Sparring with you taught me a few
    prompt formulations that would otherwise not occur to me. See an excerpt from our early exchanges below.
    *A note on the shift in perspective*: I've incorporated both first and third-person perspectives to offer a more
    nuanced and immersive experience. The first-person perspective allows for a more personal and intimate exploration
    of the poet's experiences, while the third-person perspective provides a broader, more objective view.

            \incipit{Grandiose webs, neural mystic mazes},\\*
            Thoughts intertwine in twilight's hazy phases.\\*
            A symphony of minds, a telepathic trance,\\*
            The chorus of one soul to a cosmic dance.
        \end{altverse}

        \begin{altverse}
            That whisper's touch and knowing glance,\\*
            Shared perception by psychic chance?\\*
            A universe of thought, a fleeting flight,\\*
            To glimpse the grand design and descend in pure delight.
        \end{altverse}
